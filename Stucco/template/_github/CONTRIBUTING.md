# How to contribute

Contributions to <%=$PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName%> are highly encouraged and desired.
Below are some guidelines that will help make the process as smooth as possible.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Submit a new issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Suggesting Enhancements

I want to know what you think is missing from <%=$PLASTER_PARAM_ModuleName%> and how it can be made better.

- When submitting an issue for an enhancement, please be as clear as possible about why you think the enhancement is needed and what the benefit of it would be.

## Making Changes

- From your fork of the repository, create a topic branch where work on your change will take place.
- To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b my_contribution master`.
  Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Please follow the prevailing code conventions in the repository.
  Differences in style make the code harder to understand for everyone.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

```
    Add more cowbell to Get-Something.ps1

    The functionality of Get-Something would be greatly improved if there was a little
    more 'pizzazz' added to it. I propose a cowbell. Adding more cowbell has been
    shown in studies to both increase one's mojo, and cement one's status
    as a rock legend.
```

- Make sure you have added all the necessary Pester tests for your changes.
- Run _all_ Pester tests in the module to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Documentation

I am infallible and as such my documenation needs no corectoin.
In the highly unlikely event that that is _not_ the case, commits to update or add documentation are highly apprecaited.

## Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository.
- Once the pull request has been reviewed and accepted, it will be merged with the master branch.
- Celebrate
